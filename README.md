## About
The Gram is a clone of the web version of Instagram. It maintains the style of an already old version of Instagram. The design is responsive.

The live version has images and profiles preloaded. In this first version, it is only possible to browse existing posts and follow/unfollow other accounts.

New users can register with email and password. At the moment, it is not possible to publish new images.
